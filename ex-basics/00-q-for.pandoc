### Q: For-loop [0]

1. Create a simple loop with the `for` construct. Make it loop
    10 times and print out the loop counter with the *fmt* package.

1. Rewrite the loop from above, to use `goto`. The
    keyword `for` may not be used.

1. Rewrite the loop again so that it fills an array and then
    prints that array to the screen.
