### A: Documentation [0]
The package *fnv* is in a *subdirectory* of
*hash*, so you will only need `go doc hash/fnv`.

Specific functions inside the "Go manual" can also be accessed. For
instance the function `Printf` is described in *fmt*. To
view the documentation for this function alone use: `go doc fmt Printf`.

All the built-in functions are also accessible by using `go doc builtin`.
