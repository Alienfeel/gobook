### Q: Documentation [0]

Go's documentation can be read with the `go doc` program, which is
included the Go distribution.

`go doc hash` gives information about the *hash* package:

    % go doc hash
    PACKAGE

    package hash

    ...
    ...
    ...

    SUBDIRECTORIES

            adler32
            crc32
            crc64
            fnv

With which `go doc` command can you read the documentation of *fnv* contained in
*hash*?
